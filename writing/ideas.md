5) How will this article support your idea?


### Idea 2 (Sweta Rauniyar)
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

My idea for the class project is "Data Compression for Sequencing Data Algorithm". This idea revolves around the methodologies that involve lossless data algorithms and how this affects the speed, efficiency and working of the system.


2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

The backbone of this idea is data and algorithms which are directly related to the field of Computer Science. The world of computer science is all about the processed information which is the data and algorithms are the mere step-by-step operations of retrieving the final result for a task, for instance: data processing.


3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years

The articles focuses on Huffman Coding and Arithmetic Encoding that are commonly used for lossless data compression and gives compression between them according to their performances.


4) What is the central thesis to the article?

The article supports the notion of Data compression by signifying its importance as it reduces data size, removes the excessive information and avoids redundancy. They address this significance in a quantitative manner and portray this phenomenon as an essential asset in the world of computer science as there is an enormous amount of data that needs to be managed properly for the convenience of the people who are using them.


5) How will this article support your idea?

This article helped me support the notion of 'Data Compression' as there are questions regarding its reliability since there is 'loss' of data. However, we need to be clear about losing data and reducing its size and for this, the article does a great job by comparing the performance of specialized comparing specialized compression algorithms and tools.

### Idea 4
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

**Topic: How to reverse the graph path and find the best path? What are the advantages and disadvantages? How to implement one of the efficient one?**

Try to find a list of graph search algorithms, and find their advantages and disadvantages. Finally try to implement an efficient one, for example, *A star search algorithm*, and use this algorithm to build a maze game. An introduction of graph search algorithm can be found [here](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/abisee/gs.pdf).

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

Graph is one of the most important data structures nowadays. It has many real-life applications, for example, map, navigation and maze running. In AI branch of computer science, how to traverse graph efficiently and quickly in a smart way is a potential question for computer science engineers.
