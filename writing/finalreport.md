### Introduction
## Include central thesis in the introduction

### Algorithms
We decided to analyze and compare the different kinds of algorithms including Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Greedy Search,, and A* Search Algorithm. The motive of our project was to find the shortest path and hence comparing them based on their functioning and eventually the drawbacks gave us a keen idea about which would be the best option for us. We researched in deeper for each of the respective algorithm to understand them in a descriptive manner.

#### Breadth-First Search
Breadth-First Search Algorithm is one of the widely used traversal technique for searching through the algorithm. In this algorithm, we start with the source node, also called the root node or the tree node. There are nodes connected to the source node, known as the neighbor nodes. These neighbor nodes are explored and then we move on to the next level of the neighbor nodes, further repeating the process all over again until we get to the end of the graph. What's happening in this algorithm is that we move through the entire graph to get to our destination and we do find the shortest path. However, since we are bound to traverse through the entire graph, this process consumes a lot of time and uses a lot of memory space. Hence, we decided that this was not a reliable option for us to work with for our project.
