//paragraph 1: our motivation, including why we choose this topic and what is our central idea

Graph is wildly applied in many areas, for example, map, navigation, maze game traverser.

In this final project, we would like to explore some common graph path traverse algorithms and analyze their complicities, then understand the advantage and disadvantage of the algorithm. Finally, we would like to pick a most efficient algorithm, and build a maze traverser upon it.

//paragraph 2: brief intro for algorithms we are going to explore

Breadth-first Search
Depth-first Search
Greedy Search
Dijkstra's Algorithm
A* Search

//paragraph 3: conclusion for expected outcome
