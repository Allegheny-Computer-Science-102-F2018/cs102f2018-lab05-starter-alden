//paragraph 1: our motivation, including why we choose this topic and what is our central idea

Graph is wildly applied in many areas, for example, map, navigation, maze game traverser.

In this final project, we would like to explore some common graph path traverse algorithms and analyze their complexiities, then understand the advantage and disadvantage of the algorithm. Finally, we would like to pick a most efficient algorithm, and build a maze traverser upon it.

//paragraph 2: brief intro for algorithms we are going to explore

Breadth-first Search
Depth-first Search
Greedy Search
Dijkstra's Algorithm
A* Search

//paragraph 3: conclusion for expected outcome


#Paragraph 1 (Sweta)
In the real world, all of us have a motive to get to our destination from our source. This is how the world of Computer Science works where we emphasize on building a path that can lead us to our desired outcome. With this concept in mind, our team desired to come up with an idea of working on Graphs for our final project. Graphs are one of the most important data structures that have been widely used as an investigated area in path finding. We would like to emphasize on the fact that our end goal is not just to discover the path but also find the shortest path. We will be analyzing the relation between all the vertices and edges of the graph, exploring some common graph path traverse algorithms and analyze their complexities, and furthermore understand the advantage and disadvantage of the algorithm. Finally, with all of these collected information,  we would like to pick a most efficient algorithm, and build a maze traverser upon it. this maze traverser works as a great application that adds to the theme of our project which is finding the shortest path.
